# Dark Mode for Basilisk
A fork of [Dark Background and Light Text](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-background-light-text/) made for [Basilisk](http://www.basilisk-browser.org/).

Unlike it's webextension equivalent, this version can change the colors in most Firefox internal pages (about:preferences, about:addons, about:config, etc), other add-ons internal pages, and addons.mozilla.org. Freedom is sweet.

###### Not compatible with Firefox 57+
